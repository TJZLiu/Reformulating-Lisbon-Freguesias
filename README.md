The problem addressed in this study revolves around the inefficiency of current administrative regionalization methods in capturing the dynamic nature of urban population
distributions. Traditional models often fail to accommodate the rapid changes and
complexity inherent in urban expansion and demographic shifts. This issue not only
poses significant challenges in urban planning and resource allocation but also has
profound implications for socio-economic development and environmental management. The intricacies of urban development necessitate a solution capable of handling
high-dimensional data and providing actionable insights that are crucial for informed
decision-making and policy formulation. We help on this matter by a novel regionalization technique based on a data-driven approach. By utilizing Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) and MaxP optimization, our method leverages the strengths of
NMF in dealing with non-negativity data to decompose high-dimensional census
datasets, while MaxP captures the spatial continuity and ensures statistically significant districts. The results from applying this method indicate a data-driven definition
of urban districts that align more closely with actual population distributions and
geographic continuities. The implications of this solution are far-reaching, offering a
new paradigm in urban regionalization that can significantly influence urban policy
and governance, facilitate resource optimization.
