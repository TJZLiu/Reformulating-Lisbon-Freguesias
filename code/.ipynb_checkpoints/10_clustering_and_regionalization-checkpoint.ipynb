    "The world's hardest questions are complex and multi-faceted.\n",
    "Effective methods to learn from data recognize this. Many questions\n",
    "and challenges are inherently multidimensional; they are affected, shaped, and\n",
    "defined by many different components all acting simultaneously. In statistical\n",
    "terms, these processes are called *multivariate processes*, as opposed to \n",
    "*univariate processes*, where only a single variable acts at once.\n",
    "Clustering is a fundamental method of geographical analysis that draws insights\n",
    "from large, complex multivariate processes. It works by finding similarities among the many dimensions in a multivariate process, condensing them down into a simpler representation.\n",
    "Thus, through clustering, a complex and difficult to understand process is recast into a simpler one that even non-technical audiences can use. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering (as we discuss it in this chapter) borrows heavily from unsupervised statistical learning {cite}`friedman2001elements`.\n",
    "Often, clustering involves sorting observations into groups without any prior idea about what the groups are (or, in machine learning jargon, without any labels, hence the _unsupervised_ name).\n",
    "These groups are delineated so that members of a group should be more\n",
    "similar to one another than they are to members of a different group.\n",
    "Each group is referred to as a *cluster* while the process of assigning\n",
    "objects to groups is known as *clustering*. If done well, these clusters can be\n",
    "characterized by their *profile*, a simple summary of what members of a group are like in terms of the original multivariate phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a good cluster is more\n",
    "similar internally than it is to any other cluster, these cluster-level profiles\n",
    "provide a convenient shorthand to describe the original complex multivariate phenomenon\n",
    "we are interested in.\n",
    "Observations in one group may have consistently high \n",
    "scores on some traits but low scores on others. \n",
    "The analyst only needs to look at the profile of a cluster in order to get a\n",
    "good sense of what all the observations in that cluster are like, instead of\n",
    "having to consider all of the complexities of the original multivariate process at once. \n",
    "Throughout data science, and particularly in geographic data science, \n",
    "clustering is widely used to provide insights on the\n",
    "(geographic) structure of complex multivariate (spatial) data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of explicitly spatial questions, a related concept, the *region*,\n",
    "is also instrumental. A *region* is similar to a *cluster*, in the sense that\n",
    "all members of a region have been grouped together, and the region should provide \n",
    "a shorthand for the original data within the region.\n",
    "For a region to be analytically useful, its members also should\n",
    "display stronger similarity to each other than they do to the members of other regions. \n",
    "However, regions are more complex than clusters because they combine this\n",
    "similarity in profile with additional information about the location of their members: they should also describe a clear geographic area. \n",
    "In short, regions are like clusters (since they have a consistent profile) where all its members\n",
    "are geographically consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating regions is called regionalization {cite}`duque2007supervised`.\n",
    "A regionalization is a special kind of clustering where the objective is \n",
    "to group observations which are similar in their statistical attributes,\n",
    "but also in their spatial location. In this sense, regionalization embeds the same\n",
    "logic as standard clustering techniques, but also applies a series of geographical constraints. Often, these\n",
    "constraints relate to connectivity: two candidates can only be grouped together in the\n",
    "same region if there exists a path from one member to another member\n",
    "that never leaves the region. These paths often model the spatial relationships\n",
    "in the data, such as contiguity or proximity. However, connectivity does not\n",
    "always need to hold for all regions, and in certain contexts it makes\n",
    "sense to relax connectivity or to impose different types of geographic constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we consider clustering techniques and regionalization methods. In the process, we will explore the socioeconomic\n",
    "characteristics of neighborhoods in San Diego. We will extract common patterns from the\n",
    "cloud of multidimensional data that the Census Bureau produces about small areas\n",
    "through the American Community Survey. We begin with an exploration of the\n",
    "multivariate nature of our dataset by suggesting some ways to examine the \n",
    "statistical and spatial distribution before carrying out any\n",
    "clustering. Focusing on the individual variables, as well as their pairwise\n",
    "associations, can help guide the subsequent application of clusterings or regionalizations. We then consider geodemographic approaches to clustering&mdash;the application\n",
    "of multivariate clustering to spatially referenced demographic data.\n",
    "Two popular clustering algorithms are employed: k-means and Ward's hierarchical method.\n",
    "As we will see, mapping the spatial distribution of the resulting clusters \n",
    "reveals interesting insights on the socioeconomic structure of the San Diego\n",
    "metropolitan area. We also see that in many cases, clusters are spatially \n",
    "fragmented. That is, a cluster may actually consist of different areas that are not\n",
    "spatially connected. Indeed, some clusters will have their members strewn all over the map. \n",
    "This will illustrate why connectivity might be important when building insight\n",
    "about spatial data, since these clusters will not at all provide intelligible regions. \n",
    "With this insight in mind, we will move on to regionalization, exploring different approaches that\n",
    "incorporate geographical constraints into the exploration of the social structure of San Diego.\n",
    "Applying a regionalization approach is not always required but it can provide\n",
    "additional insights into the spatial structure of the multivariate statistical relationships\n",
    "that traditional clustering is unable to articulate.\n",

    "In this case, we know that the housing values are in the hundreds of thousands, but the Gini coefficient (which we discussed in the previous chapter) is constrained to fall between zero and one. So, for example, the distance between the first two observations is nearly totally driven by the difference in median house value (which is 259100 dollars) and ignores the difference in the Gini coefficient (which is about .11). Indeed, a change of a single dollar in median house value will correspond to *the maximum possible* difference in Gini coefficients.

    "First, all observations are randomly assigned one of the $k$ labels. Next, the \n",

    "While we must remember our earlier caveat about how irregular polygons can \n",

    "\n",
    "Fragmented clusters are not intrinsically invalid, particularly if we are\n",
    "interested in exploring the overall structure and geography of multivariate\n",
    "data. However, in some cases, the application we are interested in might\n",
    "require that all the observations in a class be spatially connected. For\n",
    "example, when detecting communities or neighborhoods (as is sometimes needed when\n",
    "drawing electoral or census boundaries), they are nearly always distinct \n",
    "self-connected areas, unlike our clusters shown above. To ensure that clusters are\n",
    "not spatially fragmented, we turn to regionalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regionalization methods are clustering techniques that impose a spatial constraint\n",
    "on clusters. In other words, the result of a regionalization algorithm contains clusters with\n",
    "areas that are geographically coherent, in addition to having coherent data profiles. \n",
    "Effectively, this means that regionalization methods construct clusters that are \n",
    "all internally-connected; these are the *regions*. Thus, a regions' members must\n",
    "be geographically *nested* within the region's boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of nesting relationship is easy to identify\n",
    "in the real world. Census geographies provide good examples: counties nest within states\n",
    "in the US; or local super output areas (LSOAs) nest within middle super output areas \n",
    "(MSOAs) in the UK. \n",
    "The difference between these real-world nestings and the output of a regionalization\n",
    "algorithm is that the real-world nestings are aggregated according to administrative\n",
    "principles, while regions' members are aggregated according to statistical similarity. In the same manner as the\n",
    "clustering techniques explored above, these regionalization methods aggregate \n",
    "observations that are similar in their attributes; the profiles of regions are useful\n",
    "in a similar manner as the profiles of clusters. But, in regionalization, the \n",
    "clustering is also spatially constrained, so the region profiles and members will\n",
    "likely be different from the unconstrained solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the non-spatial case, there are many different regionalization methods.\n",
    "Each has a different way to measure (dis)similarity, how the similarity is used\n",
    "to assign labels, how these labels are iteratively adjusted, and so on. However,\n",
    "as with clustering algorithms, regionalization methods all share a few common traits.\n",
    "In particular, they all take a set of input attributes and a representation of \n",
    "spatial connectivity in the form of a binary spatial weights matrix. Depending \n",
    "on the algorithm, they also require the desired number of output regions. For\n",
    "illustration, we will take the AHC algorithm we have just used above, and apply \n",
    "an additional spatial constraint. In `scikit-learn`, this is done using\n",
    "our spatial weights matrix as a `connectivity` option.\n",
    "This parameter will force the agglomerative algorithm to only allow observations to be grouped\n",
    "in a cluster if they are also spatially connected:"

    "Even though we have specified a spatial constraint, the constraint applies to the\n",
    "connectivity graph modeled by our weights matrix. Therefore, using k-nearest neighbors\n",
    "to constrain the agglomerative clustering may not result in regions that are connected\n",
    "according to a different connectivity rule, such as the queen contiguity rule used\n",
    "in the previous section. However, the regionalization here is fortuitous; even though\n",
    "we used the 4-nearest tracts to constrain connectivity, all of our clusters are also connected according to the Queen contiguity rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, which one is a \"better\" regionalization? Well, regionalizations are often compared based on measures of *geographical coherence*, as well as measures of *cluster coherence*.

    "One very simple measure of geographical coherence involves the \"compactness\" of a given shape. The most common of these measures is the isoperimetric quotient {cite}`Horn1993`. This compares the area of the region to the area of a circle with the same perimeter as the region. To obtain the statistic, we can recognize that the circumference of the circle $c$ is the same as the perimeter of the region $i$, so $P_i = 2\\pi r_c$. Then, the area of the isoperimetric circle is $A_c = \\pi r_c^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{P_i}{2 \\pi}\\right)^2$. Simplifying, we get:\n",

    "\n",
    "For this measure, more compact shapes have an IPQ closer to 1, whereas very elongated or spindly shapes will have IPQs closer to zero. For the clustering solutions, we would expect the IPQ to be very small indeed, since the perimeter of a cluster/region gets smaller the more boundaries that members share. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, clustering and regionalization are two complementary tools to reduce\n",
    "complexity in multivariate data and build better understandings of their spatial structure.\n",
    "Often, there is simply too much data to examine every variable's map and its\n",
    "relation to all other variable maps. \n",
    "Thus, clustering reduces this complexity into a single conceptual shorthand by which \n",
    "people can easily describe complex and multifaceted data. \n",
    "Clustering constructs groups of observations (called *clusters*)\n",
    "with coherent *profiles*, or distinct and internally-consistent \n",
    "distributional/descriptive characteristics. \n",
    "These profiles are the conceptual shorthand, since members of each cluster should\n",
    "be more similar to the cluster at large than they are to any other cluster. \n",
    "Many different clustering methods exist; they differ on how the cluster\n",
    "is defined, and how \"similar\" members must be to clusters, or how these clusters\n",
    "are obtained.\n",
    "Regionalization is a special kind of clustering that imposes an additional geographic requirement. \n",
    "Observations should be grouped so that each spatial cluster,\n",
    "or *region*, is spatially-coherent as well as data-coherent. \n",
    "Thus, regionalization is often concerned with connectivity in a contiguity \n",
    "graph for data collected in areas; this ensures that the regions that are identified\n",
    "are fully internally-connected. \n",
    "However, since many regionalization methods are defined for an arbitrary connectivity structure,\n",
    "these graphs can be constructed according to different rules as well, such as the k-nearest neighbor graph. \n",
    "Finally, while regionalizations are usually more geographically-coherent, they are also usually worse-fit to the features at hand. This reflects an intrinsic tradeoff that, in general, cannot be removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we discussed the conceptual basis for clustering and regionalization, \n",
    "as well as showing why clustering is done. \n",
    "Further, we have demonstrated how to build clusters using a combination of (geographic) data \n",
    "science packages, and how to interrogate the meaning of these clusters as well.\n",
    "More generally, clusters are often used in predictive and explanatory settings, \n",
    "in addition to being used for exploratory analysis in their own right.\n",
    "Clustering and regionalization are intimately related to the analysis of spatial autocorrelation as well,\n",
    "since the spatial structure and covariation in multivariate spatial data is what\n",
    "determines the spatial structure and data profile of discovered clusters or regions.\n",
    "Thus, clustering and regionalization are essential tools for the geographic data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What disciplines employ regionalization? Cite concrete examples for each discipline you list.\n",
    "2. Contrast and compare  the concepts of *clusters* and *regions*?\n",
    "3. In evaluating the quality of the solution to a regionalization problem, how might traditional measures of cluster evaluation be used? In what ways might those measures be limited and need expansion to consider the geographical dimensions of the problem?\n",
    "4. Discuss the implications for the processes of regionalization that follow from the number of *connected components* in the spatial weights matrix that would be used.\n",
    "5. Consider two possible weights matrices for use in a spatially constrained clustering problem. Both form a single connected component for all the areal units. However, they differ in the sparsity of their adjacency graphs (think Rook being less dense than Queen graphs). \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. How might the sparsity of the weights matrix affect the quality of the clustering solution?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Using `pysal.lib.weights.higher_order`, construct a second-order adjacency matrix of the weights matrix used in this chapter. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Compare the `pct_nonzero` for both matrices. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Rerun the analysis from this chapter using this new second-order weights matrix. What changes? \n",
    " \n",
    "6. The idea of spatial dependence, that near things tend to be more related than distant things, is an extensively-studied property of spatial data. How might solutions to clustering and regionalization problems change if dependence is very strong and positive? very weak? very strong and negative? \n",
    "7. Using a spatial weights object obtained as `w = pysal.lib.weights.lat2W(20,20)`, what are the number of unique ways to partition the graph into 20 clusters of 20 units each, subject to each cluster being a connected component? What are the unique number of possibilities for `w = pysal.lib.weights.lat2W(20,20, rook=False)` ?"
